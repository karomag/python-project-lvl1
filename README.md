# Project "Brain Games" (level 1)

## Description
A set of mini-games launched from the console.

* ["Parity Check"](#game-parity-check)
* ["Calculator"](#game-calculator)
* ["Greatest common divisor"](#game-greatest-common-divisor)
* ["Arithmetic progression"](#game-arithmetic-progression)
* ["Is the number prime?](#game-is-the-number-prime)

### brain-even
The user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

### brain-calc
The user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

### brain-progression

It shows the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two points. The player must determine this number.
